PySSRstat is copyright 2015 by Mario Nenno. See file LISCENSE.txt.

PySSRstat version 1.0 does not come with a standard setuptool setup.
Just copy the PySSRstat directory where it is comfortable for you.


MS WINDOWS
----------
The PySSRstat directory contains already for each of its programs a
batch file. All that remains to do is to set the PYSSRSTAT_HOME environment
variable to the directory where your copied PySSRstat to and add it to your
PATH variable.

Here an example where you copied PySSRstat to C:\PySSRstat

SET PYSSRSTAT_HOME=C:\PySSRstat
SET PATH=%PATH%;%PYSSRSTAT_HOME%

I recommend to save these two lines in a batch file (e.g. setpath.bat).


USAGE example
-------------
1) Prerequisite:
   - the environment variable PYSSRSTAT_HOME is set and
     added to the PATH variable (see above)
   - you ran the MISA Perl script and have two output files named e.g.:
     file.misa and file.statistics

2) Launch the statistics_misa.py program of PySSRstat with:

    statistics_misa.bat file.misa file.statistics
